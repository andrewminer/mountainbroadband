                        <p>Hooray!  Comcast has provided the costs for the Phase II build-out, and we're ready to start
                            fundraising!  You'll find all the details on the <a href="contribute.html">Contribute
                            Now!</a> page, but the work the Mountain Broadband team did over the summer has lowered
                            costs by <i>50%</i> from what was announced in June!</p>
                        <p>The second big change is that our deadline is now <b>February 28th!</b>  The change is
                            because Comcast is eager to get started with the planning, and therefore would like to get
                            our portion of the money sooner so they can get started sooner.</p>
                        <p>The time has come for each of us to decide what having reliable, wired, high-speed internet
                            access is worth to us.  Recall all the <a href="benefits.html">benefits</a>, and consider
                            the cost savings as you decide how much you would like to contribute to your route's
                            fundraiser.  And, of course, if you have any questions check the
