                        <p class="date">11-NOV-2012</p>
                        <p>We have another update from Comcast, and it's a little bit of bad news, but mostly good news.
                            The bad news is that, due to the phase 1 build-out and other projects, they have not been
                            able to review our proposed routes, and will not have costing information available for us
                            until after the new year.  They're going to start looking into our proposal in detail this
                            coming week, and they've invited us to send a few people to talk with them about what we
                            have in mind.</p>
                        <p>The good news is the Comcast corporate office has already given budgetary approval for the
                            phase 2 build-out!  This means that so long as we're able to raise our side of the money,
                            the project is a go!  The other piece of good news is that they won't need our portion of
                            the money until July of next year, but construction is expected to begin around the same
                            time.</p>
                        <p>This doesn't mean we're done yet, though. The planning team is going to use this time to make
                            sure we're ready to go as soon as we get some solid numbers from Comcast in early January.
                            Stay tuned, and we'll post further details as we get them.
