                        <p>It's official!  Comcast has accepted our offer! This past Friday, the team delivered a
                            check for $150,000 to Comcast and got their approval to <i>proceed with all routes</i>.  As
                            part of the funding, the county released $100,000 from the rural broadband fund which
                            Comcast has been collecting for a total of $250,000. From there, Comcast discounted several
                            routes which hadn't quite met their funding goals, and accepted the entire project as
                            described on this website.</p>
                        <p>Please bear in mind that some routes have individual costs for trenching which are not
                            included in this amount, so please contact your route leader if you were about to make a
                            contribution&mdash;it may still be needed!</p>
                        <p>This has been a huge effort, and a lot of people have put in a lot of work to make all this
                            happen!  Many thanks to the Mountain Broadband team for their incredible efforts over the
                            past year:</p>

                            is a community effort, and the success of the project ultimately comes from the generous
                            people in the community who opened their wallets to make this project possible!</p>
                        <p>The next step is for Comcast to come out and do the actual engineering work necessary to get
                            the ball rolling, so if you see Comcast trucks in the neighborhood, wave and give them a
                            smile!  We'll keep everyone informed as things progress.</p>

                        <p class="title">So Now What?</p>
                        <p class="date">02-MAR-2013</p>
                        <p>So, we're past February 28th, and no doubt the question on your mind is: "What happens
                            now?"  Good question.  We've spoken with Comcast and given them a rough idea of where we are
                            with fundraising, and we'll be talking with them again later this week to finalize the
                            details of how/when we send them the money, and who gets included.</p>
                        <p>However, we're still about $26,000 short total across several routes (particularly along
                            our three big routes: A, C and E), so if you're on the fence, please consider hopping down
                            and joining the effort!  Here's a letter from Shea Moss on route E who recently did:</p>
                        <blockquote>I finally gave in and became a participant.  I wasn't going to do it.  I was dead
                            against it.  I was really outraged that we would have to pay for Comcast's infrastructure,
                            when everyone I know just had to sign up and pay the monthly fee.  Unfair, I
                            thought.</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>But I went to the meeting on Saturday and listened to our neighbors who were
                            participating. I went around and talked to individuals.  Some felt like I do, but decided to
                            invest in the community and in the future.  One woman told me she is 64 and plans to move
                            out in about 6 years.  She knows she will have a hard time selling her house without
                            internet access, and will get a much lower price.  One young couple with an infant didn't
                            want to have her son growing up without access to all the wonders of the internet. Others
                            were trying to work at home more and communicate with their offices in the Valley.  Some
                            people work out of their homes and have very small businesses just getting by with what
                            Verizon has to offer. Some people who were retired just wanted more entertainment, and  to
                            be able to watch movies at home. I thought, these people all have valid reasons, but, should
                            I care?</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>I didn't give my check right then, but as I was driving home, I had to ask myself,
                            why do I live here if I can't spend a little bit of money to support my community.  I don't
                            have little kids, but I still pay for schools and all that.  What if the shoe were on the
                            other foot?  I'd be desperate to participate.  And here's the thing, all you have to do is
                            participate.  If you don't want to throw one of the suggested amounts into the pot,  just
                            throw in what you would spend on a weekend in say, Yountville with dinner at the French
                            Laundry, or a weekend fly fishing in Montana, or green fees for 4 at Pebble Beach, or
                            whatever you can dream of.   If you think of it that way, it won't hurt as much.  And the
                            benefits will last much longer.  I think the County and Comcast are watching us, to see how
                            many people really want better service.  They want to give it to us, but we have to show we
                            want it by putting down some 'serious money.'</blockquote>
                        <p>We commend Shea for giving this some real thought, and choosing the long-term benefits of
                            having wired broadband in our community.  While we nail down the final details, we urge
                            everyone else who's still thinking about it to do the same.</p>

                        <p>We'd like to invite everyone to join us a Potluck social at Skyland Church on February 23rd
                            at 3:00pm. The members of the Mountain Broadband team will be there along with some people
                            who have been receiving service as part of the Phase I expansion. Please bring your favorite
                            potluck dishes and a checkbook to make your contribution!</p>
                        <p>By the time the potluck happens, we'll be less than a week away from our deadline for raising
                            the money we need to the project, so it will probably be your last chance to get your
                            questions answered and contribute!  You can see how your specific route is down on the
                            <a href="contribute.html">Contribute Now!</a> page, but everyone still has a little ways to
                            go, so if you haven't contributed yet, please consider doing so at the party on
