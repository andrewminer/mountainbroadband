                    community as of 7/2/2012. In addition to the routes, it has the state of individual homes marked on
                    it. Green shows a house which we know to be interested (at some price level), red shows a house
                    which we know to be uninterested, yellow a house for which we don't have any information, and blue a
                    house we've contacted but from which we haven't heard anything.</p>
