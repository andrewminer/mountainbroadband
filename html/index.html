                        <p class="title">Comcast Meeting</p>
                        <p class="date">16-DEC-2012</p>
                        <p>Just before Thanksgiving, we were able to sit down with Comcast and discuss the details of
                            our plan.  We talked through the various routes, what would be involved, and got a pretty
                            good picture of how Comcast is going to proceed. Here are the most important points of what
                            we learned:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We will hear back on the budget for each route in early-mid January.</li>
                            <li>Funds will be due to Comcast April 1st (i.e., back to the origin schedule)</li>
                            <li>Where necessary, easement documents will be needed April 1st as well.</li>
                            <li>The standard hook-up fees for individual homes will be:<ul>
                                <li>overhead line up to 300': $50</li>
                                <li>underground conduit up to 300': $50 (Comcast digs the trench)</li>
                                <li>underground conduit 300' to 500': $50 (owner digs the trench)</li>
                                <li>over 500': Comcast will assess individual cases</li>
                            </ul></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>So, things are generally moving in a very good direction, and we now have a much more
                            definite idea of when we'll be able to start the fundraising.  We'll keep everyone informed
                            as the time approaches!</p>

                        <p class="title">Updated Timeline (again)</p>
                        <p class="date">11-NOV-2012</p>
                        <p>We have another update from Comcast, and it's a little bit of bad news, but mostly good news.
                            The bad news is that, due to the phase 1 build-out and other projects, they have not been
                            able to review our proposed routes, and will not have costing information available for us
                            until after the new year.  They're going to start looking into our proposal in detail this
                            coming week, and they've invited us to send a few people to talk with them about what we
                            have in mind.</p>
                        <p>The good news is the Comcast corporate office has already given budgetary approval for the
                            phase 2 build-out!  This means that so long as we're able to raise our side of the money,
                            the project is a go!  The other piece of good news is that they won't need our portion of
                            the money until July of next year, but construction is expected to begin around the same 
                            time.</p>
                        <p>This doesn't mean we're done yet, though. The planning team is going to use this time to make
                            sure we're ready to go as soon as we get some solid numbers from Comcast in early January.
                            Stay tuned, and we'll post further details as we get them.

                        <p>We have recently gotten an update from Comcast, and we now have a much more definite idea
                            of what the timeline will be for fundraising, sending money to Comcast, the actual
                            build-out, and when service will go live.<p>
                        <p>In short, we expect to have actual costs for the routes in late October, and we will need
                            to turn over the money for the community portion to Comcast at the end of March, 2013.
                            In between, we will be organizing fundraising efforts for each route to help them meet
                            their targets.</p>
                        <p>We are also organizing a non-profit organization to accept and manage donations, and you
                            will hear more from us when that is ready to go.</p>

                        <p>This website provides information for anyone interested in the ongoing efforts to bring
                            high-speed internet access to the Loma Prieta community in the Santa Cruz Mountains. This
                            has been a multi-year, multi-phase project. Phase I of the project is nearly complete with
                            service expected to come online in the next few weeks.  Phase II is finishing the planning
                            stage and is about to enter the fundraising stage.<p>
                        <p class="action_prompt">Read the <a href="about.html">About</a> section for more project
                            history</p>
                        <p>The Phase II build out will be organized according to individual neighborhoods corresponding
                            to the routes the cable will follow.  Each neighborhood will need to pay for a portion of
                            the cost for building out that route.  Those routes that can raise the necessary funds will
                            be included in the build out, while those that cannot, will not.  To that end, we will be
                            organizing a fundraising effort in each neighborhood in the next few weeks.</p>
                        <p class="action_prompt">Examine the <a href="routes.html">Routes</a> and contact your route
                            leader</p>
                        <p>It costs about $60,000 per mile to install the necessary cable and hardware for wired
                            internet service and we have over 13 miles to cover, so this is going to be a huge project.
                            It is also a huge investment with a number of far-reaching benefits.</p>

                            service levels, etc. until we hear back from Comcast about our proposal.  In the meantime

                            We're your neighbors, friends and family, and we all want wired, high-speed connections in
                            our homes too.  We're volunteering our time to try to make the most of this opportunity to
                            get a faster, cheaper and more reliable connection.  While Comcast is currently the best
                            contender, we're not affiliated with them in any way.  We just want the best service we can
                            get for the best price.  We hope we can count on your help.
