                        <p>We have recently gotten an update from Comcast, and we now have a much more definite idea of
                            what the timeline will be for fundraising, sending money to Comcast, the actual build-out,
                            and when service will go live.<p>
                        <p>In short, we expect to have actual costs for the routes in late October, and we will need to
                            turn over the money for the community portion to Comcast at the end of March, 2013.  In
                            between, we will be organizing fundraising efforts for each route to help them meet their
                            targets.</p>
                        <p>We are also organizing a non-profit organization to accept and manage donations, and you will
                            hear more from us when that is ready to go.</p>

                        <p class="date">10-SEP-2012</p>
                        <p>This website provides information for anyone interested in the ongoing efforts to bring
                            high-speed internet access to the Loma Prieta community in the Santa Cruz Mountains. This
                            has been a multi-year, multi-phase project. Phase I of the project is nearly complete with
                            service expected to come online in the next few weeks.  Phase II is finishing the planning
                            stage and is about to enter the fundraising stage.<p>
                        <p class="action_prompt">Read the <a href="about.html">About</a> section for more project
                            history</p>
                        <p>The Phase II build out will be organized according to individual neighborhoods corresponding
                            to the routes the cable will follow.  Each neighborhood will need to pay for a portion of
                            the cost for building out that route.  Those routes that can raise the necessary funds will
                            be included in the build out, while those that cannot, will not.  To that end, we will be
                            organizing a fundraising effort in each neighborhood in the next few weeks.</p>
                        <p class="action_prompt">Examine the <a href="routes.html">Routes</a> and contact your route
                            leader</p>
                        <p>It costs about $60,000 per mile to install the necessary cable and hardware for wired
                            internet service and we have over 13 miles to cover, so this is going to be a huge project.
                            It is also a huge investment with a number of far-reaching benefits.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, we won't have exact answers to many relevant questions of cost, schedule,
                            service levels, etc. until we hear back from Comcast about our proposal.  In the meantime
                            however, we are here to share what information we do have, and get answers to your
                            questions.</p>

                            We're your neighbors, friends and family, and we all want wired, high-speed connections in
                            our homes too.  We're volunteering our time to try to make the most of this opportunity to
                            get a faster, cheaper and more reliable connection.  While Comcast is currently the best
                            contender, we're not affiliated with them in any way.  We just want the best service we can
                            get for the best price.  We hope we can count on your help.
