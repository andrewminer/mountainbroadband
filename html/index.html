                        <p>Hooray!  Comcast has provided the costs for the Phase II build-out, and we're ready to start
                            fundraising!  You'll find all the details on the <a href="contribute.html">Contribute
                            Now!</a> page, but the work the Mountain Broadband team did over the summer has lowered
                            costs by <i>50%</i> from what was announced in June!  Even the most expensive routes now
                            come out to less than an average per-home cost of under $2,000.</p>
                        <p>The second big change is that our deadline is now <b>February 28th!</b>  The change is
                            because Comcast is eager to get started with the planning, and therefore would like to get
                            our portion of the money sooner so they can get started sooner.</p>
                        <p>The time has come for each of us to decide what having reliable, wired, high-speed internet
                            access is worth to us.  Recall all the <a href="benefits.html">benefits</a>, and consider
                            the cost savings as you decide how much you would like to contribute to your route's
                            fundraiser.  And, of course, if you have any questions check the
                            <a href="faq.html">F.A.Q.</a> or contact your <a href="routes.html">route leader</a>.

                        <p class="title">Comcast Meeting</p>
                        <p class="date">16-DEC-2012</p>
                        <p>Just before Thanksgiving, we were able to sit down with Comcast and discuss the details of
                            our plan.  We talked through the various routes, what would be involved, and got a pretty
                            good picture of how Comcast is going to proceed. Here are the most important points of what
                            we learned:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We will hear back on the budget for each route in early-mid January.</li>
                            <li>Funds will be due to Comcast April 1st (i.e., back to the origin schedule)</li>
                            <li>Where necessary, easement documents will be needed April 1st as well.</li>
                            <li>The standard hook-up fees for individual homes will be:<ul>
                                <li>overhead line up to 300': $50</li>
                                <li>underground conduit up to 300': $50 (Comcast digs the trench)</li>
                                <li>underground conduit 300' to 500': $50 (owner digs the trench)</li>
                                <li>over 500': Comcast will assess individual cases</li>
                            </ul></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>So, things are generally moving in a very good direction, and we now have a much more
                            definite idea of when we'll be able to start the fundraising.  We'll keep everyone informed
                            as the time approaches!</p>
