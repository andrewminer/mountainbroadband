                    <dd>The engineer from Comcast's local office will review our proposal and give final approval on the
                        plan. At this time, we will also learn the actual cost for each route and which houses will be

                        necessary amount for those routes which were able to raise sufficient money.  For those routes
                        which were not, the money they raised will be returned to the donors.</dd>
