                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                <h2>What will it cost me?</h2>
                <p>There are several components to the final cost.  First, let's consider the standard hookup fee.  Each
                    new Comcast subscriber (everywhere, not just for Phase II) must pay a hookup fee.  The standard
                    hook-up fees for individual homes will be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>overhead line up to 300': $50</li>
                    <li>underground conduit up to 300': $50 (Comcast digs the trench)</li>
                    <li>underground conduit 300' to 500': $50 (owner digs the trench)</li>
                    <li>over 500': Comcast will assess individual cases</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition to your individual costs, we must also pay a portion of the costs to build out the wires,
                    poles, and other hardware to bring the signal into each neighborhood.  The community has been
                    divided into various routes for this purpose, and you can see the amounts each route must raise on
                    the <a href="fundraising.html">Donate Now!</a> page.  We've recommended various donation levels to
                    guide you in considering how much to donate to your route.</p>
                <p>So, the initial cost for you really comes down to: what you choose to donate toward your route's
                    basic infrastructure plus either the basic hookup fee (if you're close to a public road) or a fee
                    you will negotiate with Comcast if you're further away.</p>
                <p>The monthly service fees will be comparable to what Comcast advertises on its website for other
                    areas.  Here's an example of <a href="images/xfinity.pdf">a brochure</a> being distributed to
                    Comcast subscribers in the area which was built out just this year.</p>

                <h2>How fast is the connection?</h2>
                <p>Our best information so far is that the lowest service level will be 6MB/s download speed with 1MB/s
                    upload speed, and the highest service level will be 16MB/s down and 4MB/s up.  However, actual
                    measured speed for people in the phase I area show 16MB/s down and 8MB/s up.</p>
                <p>It is also worth noting that Comcast is restricted in the service levels it can provide to Santa Cruz
                    County until it's current agreement with the county expires in 2014. At that time, we have been told
                    that Comcast will convert to an all-digital technology which can provide much higher speeds.</p>

                <h2>When will I get service?</h2>
                <p>We are currently fundraising for phase II which is scheduled to begin construction in the summer and
                    which should start going live in Q4 of this year.</p>

                <h2>Will I need to grant an easement to Comcast?</h2>
                <p>Probably not. The vast majority of homes will qualify for standard hookups, and the vast bulk of the
                    wires, trenches, and equipment will be installed on county property.  These will not require an
                    easement, and wherever possible, Comcast will use these routes.</p>
                <p>However, there are some places where it will be necessary to cross certain individuals' properties.
                    We are aware of all of these cases and will approach home owners individually to discuss easements.
                    If, after checking the <a href="routes.html">route maps</a>, you believe a route will cross your
                    property, please feel free to contract your route leader with any questions.</p>

                <h2>Who will be collecting money and when?</h2>
                <p>The Santa Cruz Mountain Alliance is a non-profit organization founded for community projects exactly
                    like this one, and we will be using it to collect and hold the monies contributed to this project.
                    We are now actively fundraising and have until February 28th to turn over a check to Comcast!  Check
                    out the <a href="fundraising.html">Donate Now!</a> page for details.</p>

                <h2>What do I do if I can't contribute very much?</h2>
                <p>We have suggested different donation levels for each route based upon the total amount of money that
                    route needs to raise and how many people will be serviced.  You should donate what you think the
                    service is worth to you.  We all have differing levels of interest in wired broadband, and we all
                    have differing levels of income and savings. Therefore, it's completely expected that some people
                    will donate more or less than others.  Even if you don't wish to donate at the suggested levels,
                    every little bit helps!</p>

                <h2>What happens if a route can't raise enough money?</h2>
                <p>That route will not be included in the build-out, and the money will be returned to the donors.</p>

                <h2>What happens if you raise too much money?</h2>
                <p>Excess funds from any given route will be returned to the donors in a way which equalizes the
                    donations from each person as much as possible.  That is, anyone who donated more than the suggested
                    Gold donation level will receive money back until they are exactly at the Gold level.  Then,
                    everyone who exceeded the Silver level will be paid back until their donation was exactly at the
                    Silver level, and so on.</p>

                <h2>What's to stop people from donating nothing and signing up later?</h2>
                <p>Nothing, really.  Comcast will not take new subscribers until six months after the service goes live,
                    but, legally, there is nothing to prevent people from signing up after that.</p>
                <p>However, this is a huge project and a huge investment. Unless everyone gets involved and helps
                    finance it, it simply won't happen.  The honest and cheaters alike won't get service.  The agreement
                    between Comcast and Santa Cruz country which requires Comcast to pay a portion of the project cost
                    expires in 2014, and any future build-out will be twice as expensive.  It is, therefore, up to each
                    person to weigh that possibility and honestly consider what wired, high-speed broadband is worth to
                    them and act accordingly, because this is the best chance we're going to get.</p>
