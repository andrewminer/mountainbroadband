                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                <h2>What will it cost me?</h2>
                <p>We don't exactly know yet, but we have a general idea.  We know that it costs roughly $60,000 per
                    mile for Comcast to install the necessary cables and hardware to provide service.  We also know that
                    we have suggested routes to Comcast which range from about a half a mile to four miles.  Based on
                    an agreement with Santa Cruz County, Comcast will provide about half the money for the expansion,
                    leaving each route to raise the other half (between $30,000 to $120,000 per route): depending on the
                    amount of cable to be laid.</p>
                <p>Each route may raise the money in whatever way they see fit, but Comcast will require a single check
                    up front from each route in order for that route to be included. We will help organize a fund raiser
                    for each route which will allow everyone to donate what they see fit.  If a route would like to
                    handle things another way, that's perfectly fine too.</p>
                <p>In addition to the cost of the general build-out, each household will need to pay Comcast's standard
                    new-account fee (around $50).  If your home is more than 300 feet from the nearest public roadway,
                    you may be subject to additional fees for Comcast to extend their lines to your home.</p>
                <p>So, the initial cost for you really comes down to: what you choose to donate toward your route's basic
                    infrastructure plus either the basic hookup fee (if you're close to a public road) or a fee you will
                    negotiate with Comcast if you're further away. The monthly service fees will be comparable to what
                    Comcast advertises on its website for other areas.</p>
                <p>We expect to hear back from Comcast in the next few weeks on the exact routes and costs, and we
                    will be in touch to provide the details at that time.</p>

                <h2>How fast is the connection?</h2>
                <p>Our best information so far is that the lowest service level will be 4MB/s download speed with 1MB/s
                    upload speed, and the highest service level will be 16MB/s down and 4MB/s up. We don't have more
                    exact information right now, but we will post it as soon as we have it available.</p>
                <p>It is also worth noting that Comcast is restricted in the service levels it can provide to Santa Cruz
                    County until it's current agreement with the county expires in 2014. At that time, we have been told
                    that Comcast will improve its offering to match the Xfinity package offered in San Jose.</p>

                <h2>When will I get service?</h2>
                <p>We are currently planning phase II which is scheduled to begin construction in the summer next year,
                    and which should go live about a year from now.</p>

                <h2>Who will be collecting money and when?</h2>
                <p>The Santa Cruz Mountain Alliance is a non-profit organization founded for community projects exactly
                    like this one, and we will be using it to collect and hold the monies contributed to this project.
                    We're not ready to collect money just yet, but you can be sure you'll hear from us when we are.</p>

                <h2>What happens if a route can't raise enough money?</h2>
                <p>That route will not be included in the build-out, and the money will be returned to the donors.</p>

                <h2>What happens if you raise too much money?</h2>
                <p>Excess funds will be returned to donors in proportion to the size of their donations.</p>

                <h2>What's to stop people from cheating by signing up later?</h2>
                <p>Nothing, really.  Comcast will not take new subscribers until six months after the initial wave of
                    subscribers has joined, but there is nothing to prevent people from signing up after that.</p>
                <p>However, this is a huge project and a huge investment. Unless everyone gets involved and helps
                    finance it, it simply won't happen.  The honest and cheaters alike won't get service. The agreement
                    between Comcast and Santa Cruz country which requires Comcast to pay a portion of the project cost
                    expires in 2014, and any future build-out will be twice as expensive. It is, therefore, up to each
                    person to weigh that possibility and honestly consider what wired, high-speed broadband is worth to
                    them and act accordingly, because this is the best chance we're going to get.</p>
