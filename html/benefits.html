                <h1 class="title">Benefits of Wired Broadband</h1>

                <p>We are not trying to sell Comcast in particular. However, Comcast is currently the only real shot we
                    have of getting a wired, high-speed connection in our homes, and we see that as incredibly
                    important. Here's why:</p>

                <h2>1. Service Quality</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>No data caps. Every other internet provider has an extremely low cap on the total amount of data
                        you can download per month (usually 5-20 GB per month)</li>
                    <li>A wired connection does not require a clear path to terrestrial or satellite based transmitters:
                        a common limitation for many households among the hills and trees</li>
                    <li>A wired connection is much more reliable than a satellite or radio-based connection</li>
                    <li>As the rest of the country's internet connections get faster (<a target="new"
                        href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/FCCSurvey.pdf">67% of homes</a> have a
                        broadband connection) websites begin to assume high bandwidth and become impossible to access
                        with a slow connection</li>
                    <li>Software updates are increasingly only available via download, and can be gigabytes in size
                        (larger than the monthly quota for some services)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Real Estate Value</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased desirability to high-tech workers increases the potential sale price of homes with
                        access to wired, high-speed internet</li>
                    <li>With wired, high-speed internet access quickly spreading, even through rural communities, homes
                        without this service are less likely to sell, and take longer to sell</li>
                    <li>All the factors affecting home value and ability to sell also apply to rentals</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Education</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch streaming video of online classes and participate in video conferences with lecturers and
                        other students</li>
                    <li>A high-speed connection is increasingly essential in primary education.  Corey Kidwell, the
                        principal at the Loma Prieta School says:
                        <blockquote>Web enabled tools are rapidly expanding in education. Students' success will be
                            greatly tied to the capacity of schools, communities, and families to access the high
                            quality Internet connection that broadband provides. Schools need to be connected, but so do
                            homes as students progress into more rigorous coursework.</blockquote></li>
                    <li>Perform research for school projects at home using the internet</li>
                    <li>Access teachers, curriculum, videos and other materials for homeschooling</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Telecommuting &amp; Home Businesses</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working from home is possible with wired broadband, allowing sharing of large files, accessing
                        databases, video conference calls, and accessing work networks via VPN.</li>
                    <li>Save a lot of money by telecommuting.  A modest estimate is that you could save $2,000 in 18
                        months by telecommuting 1 day per week. (Assumes 50 mile round trip, 30 mpg @ $4/gallon,
                        $0.15/mile for vehicle wear and depreciation, and $20/hour for a 1 hour daily commute)</li>
                    <li>Businesses are increasingly moving to using always-on, fully-connected "cloud services" to
                        perform basic functions (file sharing, backup, source control, project management) and these
                        services use considerable bandwidth</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Social Interaction</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subscribing to Comcast's VOIP phone service allows a cheaper alternative to traditional phone
                        service</li>
                    <li>Facebook and other social media sites consume an increasing amount of bandwidth</li>
                    <li>Keep in touch with distant friends and family with video calling services such as Skype,
                        FaceTime and others</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Entertainment</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Comcast offers multiple cable TV packages which can be combined with broadband internet service
                        to offer substantial savings over other options</li>
                    <li>Stream on-demand movies and TV shows from services such as Netflix, iTunes, Amazon Prime, and
                        Hulu</li>
                    <li>Play online video games with your computer, XBox, PS3, Wii or other game console</li>
                    <li>Download books, music, and other materials almost instantly</li>
                </ul>
