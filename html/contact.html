                    <p>Your first point of contact should be your route leader.  They attend our regular meetings and
                        have all the information available.  They are also your neighbors and have the same interests
                        you do!  Please click the map to the right to find your home and determine your route leader.<p>
                    <p>If you have a correction or question about this website, or are unsure who your route leader is,
                        you can contact <a href="mailto:andrewminer@mac.com">Andrew Miner</a> or
                        <a href="mailto:communityorganizer.lopp@gmail.com">Larry Lopp</a>.</p>
                    <p>Please, <b>do not</b> contact Comcast directly at this time.  We have been working with them for
                        a while now, and have identified the best people to talk to about this project. As you might
                        expect, they are very busy, and it is distracting to receive a lot of email requests.  If you
                        would like to ask Comcast a question, please send it to your route leader, and we will be sure
                        to get you an answer if we don't know it already.</p>
